			<h1>Dyslexia</h1>
			<p>Dyslexia has established itself as the most famous Specific Learning Disorder (SLD) in today's society. Although it is a well-known disorder, a truthful dyslexia diagnosis is very hard to find, often being wrongly applied to people with low ability levels for reading and/or writing. 
			To understand dyslexia, firstly, we got to determine what it is not:<br><br>
			1- It is neither a sign of low intelligence levels, nor a sign of laziness. To be dyslexic, one has to display an average intelligence level, with dyslexia being a "maladjusted relationship between intelligence and reading proficiency".<br><br>
			2- It is not a visual problem, the issue resides in being able to verbally encode a normal visual input, which means that the focus point of the disorder is the brain, not the eyes. Some children diagnosed with dyslexia describe reading as "letters dancing on paper", which may be correlated with the abnormal ocular movements they display when reading. Although this is related with the magnocellular system, it is a consequence of dyslexia, not a cause.<br><br>
			3- It is not the same as "mirror writing". Despite the facts that dyslexia is more prevalent among kids with higher difficulty levels in right-left orientation, this is not diagnose criteria. The same also applies to crossed laterality.<br><br>
			Dyslexia is a variable condition, therefore, its effects, or their intensity, may be different in each person. However, there is a common symptom that starts to display in primary school: the slow and late learning of letters, and their inherent sounds. With the advance of the school years, reading is supposed to get progressively faster and exact, however, comprehension is always the main goal of this process. With practice, the average child develops the "automatic decoding" of words and phrases, focusing in memorizing and comprehending the desired content. Children with dyslexia do not develop this capability, and reading remains slow, without intonation and exhaustive. As consequences, comprehension levels decrease massively leading, affecting vocabulary development and academic knowledge, as a whole. The ability to read is the main pillar of academic learning, therefore, dyslexia creates a huge obstacle to progress in school, with harmful long-term effects on the development of cognitive, social and emotional abilities. Although a real diagnosis can only be made at 7-8 years of age, it is fundamental to recognise the early signs, in order to inicialize special clinical intervention, since children with dyslexia tend to respond really well to them, when they are made in time.
			<br><br>
			Dyslexia originates from a deficit in phonological processing, affecting phonological conscience mechanisms, such as the quick recall of words or verbal memory. Phonological conscience resides in the ability to comprehend that spoken language consists of sound units, (like syllables or isolated sounds), and the understanding that the manipulation of these units allows the creation of new words. Children with dyslexia tend to fail in doing so, not recognising that words are composed by or may be divided into different sounds, therefore, their learning of how to read may be substancially delayed.<br><br>
			Verbal memory, intrinsically connected to the quick recall of words, is equally important in the aquisition of the ability to read. When we are exposed to known words, such as "clock", we read them automatically, however, when we try to read, for instance, the pseudoword "ashumiebukazo", we use phonological decoding, residing on the successive associations between letters and sounds. For people with dyslexia, due to the deficit in phonological processing, this decoding is considerably slow, being made unit by unit. This causes the information to not be stored in their verbal memory, affecting reading comprehension and vocabulary development. A child with dyslexia takes so much time to read a word, that by the time they advance 2 or 3 words in the phrase, what was read previously has already been forgotten.<br><br>
			By the time a children start studying other subjects, if a child with dyslexia is still learning how to read, the hiatus between them increases, leading to multiple consequences, in different areas. Early intervention is key to allow these kids to open their future horizons, so, if you think that your child shows any of these signs, try to seek a psychological diagnosis. Furthermore, it needs to be said that this condition does not dictate one's success. There are many famous dyslexics, such as Thomas Edinson, or Tom Cruise.
			<br><br>
			We, at Laozi, developed this game, called Wordl, in which the player has to try to uncover a five-letter word, with feedback given for each guess. This allows the player to develop their vocabulary and their word recall ability, while combining it with strategy, and, of course, a little bit of luck. We hope you enjoy and <b class="goodluck">Good Luck!</b>
