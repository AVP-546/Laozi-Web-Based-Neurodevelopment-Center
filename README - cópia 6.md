# CSS Wordle Game

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/jonslater204/pen/xxPKmNE](https://codepen.io/jonslater204/pen/xxPKmNE).

A CSS-only version of the excellent https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/.

Click "OK" to read through the instructions. Then click the letters to form a 5-letter word in the grid. Click "Enter" to submit your guess.

Includes high-contrast setting.

Doesn't handle repeated letters properly yet.
Hopefully I can optimise the CSS to improve the performance. The SCSS for it even seems to be too large to compile right now.
