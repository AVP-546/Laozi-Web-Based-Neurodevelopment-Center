	<h1>Our Objective</h1>
	<p> Laozi Was Designed With The Purpose Of Helping The Younger Generations, In A Fun, But Didactical Way. Our Content's Main Focus Is The Development Of The Intelectual Capabilities Affected By The Different Neurological Conditions. Additionally, We Also Created Other Non-Related Brain-Teasing Games, That Make The Platform More Appealing To Everyone. </p>

			<h3>Dyslexia</h3>
			<p>Dyslexia is an unexpected difficulty in reading for an individual. It is most commonly due to a difficulty in phonological processing, which affects the ability of an individual to speak, read, spell and, often, learn a second language.</p></a>
		</div>
		<div class="course-col"><a href="discalculia.html">
			<h3>Dyscalculia</h3>
			<p>Dyscalculia is a learning disorder that affects a person’s ability to do math. Much like dyslexia disrupts areas of the brain related to reading, dyscalculia affects brain areas that handle math- and number-related skills and understanding. </p></a>

		<div class="course-col"><a href="outrosjogos.html">
			<h3>Other Games</h3>
			<p>Our developers also made available different games for users that just want to have fun on our platform. Of course, playing these, you can increase your level of knowledge, or even test your skills in certain areas, such as reaction time or geography. </p></a>

	<p>Our team developed videogames that test users capabilities in different areas. You can test your reaction time playing The Snake Game, or evaluate your general knowledge on our Trivia Quiz. We just ask for one thing, have fun while you do it.

			<p>My youngest child has dyscalculia. With the help of this platform, I managed to keep him entertained while he learnt a great amount. I can't help but to notice a significant development in my son's mental calculus. The only thing left for me to do is to thank the creators of Laozi for their admirable work!</p>

			<p>Great family-friendly platform! Promotes the development of my young ones, while still having fun and interacting with their family. As an adult, it made me learn more about the various conditions. However, it would be great to have new features and new games for other conditions in future updates.</p>
