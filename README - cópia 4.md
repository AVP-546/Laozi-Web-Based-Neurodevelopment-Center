# React Math Game

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/ykadosh/pen/NBQRQj](https://codepen.io/ykadosh/pen/NBQRQj).

This is a basic multiple-choice Math game, in which you play against the clock to solve as many problems as possible. 

I wanted to develop a simple game for my daughter to practice Math in a fun way. Therefore I added vivid colors and animations to make it more responsive to the player.

Game Rules:

- The "up to" value specifies the max value for the result of a question.
- A correct answer increases the score by the current "up to" value.
- A correct answer also increases the score multiplier by 1.
- A wrong answer decreases the value by "up to" divided by 2.
- A wrong answer also resets the score multiplier.
- Every 5 correct answers, the "up to" value is doubled, and 15 seconds are added to the clock.

Let's see how far you can get!
