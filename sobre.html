			<h1>Dyslexia</h1>
			<p>Dyslexia is the most famous member of the Specific Learning Disorders (SLD's) group, and, although it affects mostly reading, it is often associated with difficulty with written expression. Having competence in reading and writing is key to most educative systems, therefore, a child with dyslexia will struggle in most curricular areas. This can lead to increasing disinterest for learning and a reduced sel-esteem, but this does not dictate one's future success, for instance, both Tom Cruise and Thomas Edinson are famous dyslexics.  </p>

			<h1>Dyscalculia</h1>
			<p>Dyscalculia influences the way that arithmetic concepts and processes are understood, originating from a neurobiological dysfunction. Although it is part of de Specific Learning Disorders (SLD's), it is often hard to diagnose due to some patients having islets of math capability, for example, being good only at geometry. For children with dyscalculia, numbers are independent entities, not recognising combinations they display, such as the recognition that a number may contain other numbers on itself (80 = 4x20, e.g.).</p>
